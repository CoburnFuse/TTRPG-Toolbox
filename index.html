        <h1>TTRPG Toolbox by CoburnFuse</h1>
        Here are some useful tools that I have created for TTRPG games. While it's not much, I am fairly sure it's useful to everyone playing TTRPG games!<br>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="combattrack/index.html">Combattrack</a><br>
            A more simplistic take on an initiative tracker that can be used for DND (and I think other TTRPGs too, it has only been tested for DND5e).
            Created because my DM got annoyed with the amount of useless trackers that either don't work well, are paid, or have lots of bells and frills.</li>
        </ul>
